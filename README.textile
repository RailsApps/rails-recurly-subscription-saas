h1. !http://railsapps.github.com/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Application for a Membership, Subscription, or SaaS Site)! Rails App for a Membership, Subscription, or SaaS Site with Recurly

Rails 3.2 example application with recurring billing using Recurly. Use for a Rails membership site, subscription site, or SaaS site (software-as-a-service). Using:

* "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise authentication and user management
* "CanCan":https://github.com/ryanb/cancan authorization for administrator access
* "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ front-end framework for CSS styling
* "Recurly":https://recurly.com/ for recurring billing and subscription management

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-recurly-subscription-saas.html to show how it's built.

You can build this application in only a few minutes using the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/ tool.

h2. Tutorial

A complete tutorial is available:

h4. "View the Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-recurly-subscription-saas.html

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. See a list of recommended resources for "Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails.html.

h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

Membership sites restrict access to content such as articles, videos, or user forums. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) sites limit use of web-based software to paid subscribers. The revenue model is the same whether the site provides high-value content or software as a service: A visitor purchases a subscription and gains access to restricted areas of the site. Typically, the subscription is repurchased monthly through a service that provides recurring billing.

The example application provides a complete and fully functional membership site.

* tiered pricing for multiple subscription plans
* optional "free trial" subscription as well as free accounts using Recurly
* uses Recurly for no local credit card storage
* Recurly accepts credit card payments from customers in any country or currency
* PCI compliance using the Recurly JavaScript library
* Recurly handles recurring billing, retries if payment fails, and cancels subscription if retries fail
* paid subscriptions are created only after a successful credit card transaction
* subscribers can upgrade or downgrade subscription plans
* subscribers can cancel subscription plans
* configurable subscription renewal period (defaults to one month)
* administrator can change subscription plan or delete user

h4. What is Not Implemented

There are additional features you may want for a SaaS application, such as:

* Basecamp-style subdomains (each user gets their own subdomain)
* "multitenancy":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy database segmentation

These features are not included in this application. See the "rails3-subdomains":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-subdomains example application for help with subdomains. For multitenancy, try Brad Robertson's "Apartment":https://github.com/bradrobertson/apartment gem.

h2. Similar Examples and Tutorials

h4. RailsApps

This is one in a series of Rails example apps and tutorials from the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.com/. See a list of additional "Rails examples, tutorials, and starter apps":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-examples-tutorials.html.

This example application is based on the "rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan starter application. This example application uses ActiveRecord and a SQLite database with RSpec and Cucumber for testing.

This application is similar to the "rails-stripe-membership-saas":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-stripe-membership-saas application which provides recurring billing using the "Stripe":https://stripe.com/ billing service.

You might also be interested in the "rails-prelaunch-signup":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup example and tutorial from the RailsApps project.

* Recurly's "recurly-client-ruby-demo":https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-ruby-demo
* Recurly's "recurly-client-ruby":https://github.com/recurly/recurly-client-ruby
* Nick O'Neill's "recurly-rails":https://github.com/biznickman/recurly-rails

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for advice about updating Rails and your development environment.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code. You can _fork_, _clone_, or _generate_.

h3. Fork

If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

h3. Clone

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below). To clone:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails-recurly-subscription-saas.git
</pre>

You'll need "git":http://git-scm.com/ on your machine. See "Rails and Git":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-git.html.

h3. Generate

If you want to use the project as a starter app, use the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/ tool to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application gives you additional options.

To build the example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new rails-recurly-subscription-saas -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb -T
</pre>

Use the @-T@ flag to skip Test::Unit files.

The @$@ character indicates a shell prompt; don't include it when you run the command.

This creates a new Rails app named @rails-recurly-subscription-saas@ on your computer. You can use a different name if you wish.

You'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Install an example application?
      1)  I want to build my own application
      2)  membership/subscription/saas
      3)  rails-prelaunch-signup
      4)  rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan
      5)  rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber
      6)  rails3-mongoid-devise
      7)  rails3-mongoid-omniauth
      8)  rails3-subdomains
</pre>

Choose *membership/subscription/saas*.

Then choose *Recurly*:

<pre>
question  Billing with Stripe or Recurly?
      1)  Stripe
      2)  Recurly
</pre>

The application generator template will ask you for additional preferences:

<pre>
 question  Web server for development?
       1)  WEBrick (default)
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
 question  Web server for production?
       1)  Same as development
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
 question  Template engine?
       1)  ERB
       2)  Haml
       3)  Slim
   extras  Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders? (y/n)
   extras  Create a project-specific rvm gemset and .rvmrc? (y/n)
   extras  Create a GitHub repository? (y/n)
</pre>

h4. Web Servers

We recommend Thin in development for speed and less noise in the log files.

If you plan to deploy to Heroku, select Thin as your production webserver.

h4. Template Engine

The example application uses the default "ERB" Rails template engine. Optionally, you can use another template engine, such as Haml or Slim. See instructions for "Haml and Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-haml.html.

h4. Other Choices

Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders if you want to keep your new site out of Google search results.

It is a good idea to use "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, and create a project-specific rvm gemset and .rvmrc file (not available on Windows). See "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html.

If you choose to create a GitHub repository, the generator will prompt you for a GitHub username and password.

h4. Troubleshooting

If you get an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" or "Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect" see the article "OpenSSL errors and Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

If you get an error like this:

<pre>
Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
    composer  Running 'after bundler' callbacks.
The template [...] could not be loaded.
Error: You have already activated ..., but your Gemfile requires ....
Using bundle exec may solve this.
</pre>

It's due to conflicting gem versions. See the article "Rails Error: “You have already activated (…)”":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-error-you-have-already-activated.html.

h3. Edit the README

If you're storing the app in a GitHub repository, please edit the README files to add a description of the app and your contact info. If you don't change the README, people will think I am the author of your version of the application.

h2. Getting Started

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html to make sure your development environment is prepared properly.

h3. Recurly Account

The application implements recurring billing using "Recurly":https://recurly.com/. Before you start, go to the Recurly website and set up an account.

h3. Merchant Account

Your business will need a merchant account in order to accept credit card payments. Recurly does not include a merchant account as part of the service. If your business is established and already taking credit card payments, you will already have a merchant account. If not, you will have to obtain a merchant account. If you have a U.S.-based business, Recurly will refer you to their partner, "TSYS Merchant Solutions":http://www.tsysmerchantsolutions.com/mark/index.html, one of the largest credit card processors in the U.S., and a salesperson will contact you to send you an application form. It takes a few days to get approval so get the process started early.

h3. Use RVM

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. If you generate the application with the Rails Composer tool, you can create a project-specific gemset.

h3. Install the Required Gems

Check the Gemfile to see which gems are used by this application.

If you generate the application with the Rails Composer tool, all gems will be installed.

Otehrwise, run the @bundle install@ command to install the required gems on your computer:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

<pre>
$ gem list
</pre>

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h3. Configure Email

You must configure the application for your email account. See the article "Send Email with Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-send-email.html.

h3. Configure Devise

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

* *config/initializers/devise.rb*

h3. Configuration File

The application uses the "figaro gem":https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro to set environment variables. Credentials for your administrator account and Recurly API and cryptographic keys are set in the *config/application.yml* file. The *.gitignore* file prevents the *config/application.yml* file from being saved in the git repository so your credentials are kept private. See the article "Rails Environment Variables":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-environment-variables.html for more information.

Modify the file *config/application.yml*:

<pre>
# Add account credentials and API keys here.
# See http://railsapps.github.com/rails-environment-variables.html
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Gmail_Username
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Username' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]
# Add application configuration variables here, as shown below.
#
GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Username
GMAIL_PASSWORD: Your_Password
ADMIN_FIRST_NAME: First
ADMIN_LAST_NAME: User
ADMIN_EMAIL: user@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD: please
ROLES: [admin, silver, gold, platinum]
RECURLY_API_KEY: = recurly_api_key
RECURLY_JS_PRIVATE_KEY: = recurly_js_private_key
RECURLY_SUBDOMAIN: myapp
</pre>

Set the user name and password needed for the application to send email.

If you wish, set your name, email address, and password for an administrator's account. If you prefer, you can use the default to sign in to the application and edit the account after deployment. It is always a good idea to change the administrator's password after the application is deployed.

The roles you specify in the configuration file are the subscription plans that will be available to the application's users. You will need an "admin" role. Keep the "silver", "gold", and "platinum" roles while you are testing the application. You can change these roles later, after you familiarize yourself with the application and begin to customize it for your own needs.

The Recurly gem requires an API key to operate. We'll also need to supply a private key so the Recurly gem can generate a cryptographic signature. You can find both keys on your Recurly account profile under "API Credentials".

Set a @RECURLY_SUBDOMAIN@ environment variable that is used in the JavaScript code that initiates the Recurly transaction. Recurly creates a customer-facing website and API interface with a subdomain on the Recurly website. The URL will look like this: @https://myapp.recurly.com/@ where "myapp" is the name of your company or service. You'll use the subdomain "myapp" to form the URL that makes requests to the Recurly API interface. The Recurly subdomain is listed on your Recurly account profile.

All configuration values in the *config/application.yml* file are available anywhere in the application as environment variables. For example, @ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]@ will return the string "Your_Username".

If you prefer, you can delete the *config/application.yml* file and set each value as an environment variable in the Unix shell.

h3. Set Up a Database Seed File

The *db/seeds.rb* file initializes the database with default values. To keep some data private, and consolidate configuration settings in a single location, we use the *config/application.yml* file to set environment variables and then use the environment variables in the *db/seeds.rb* file.

<pre>
puts 'ROLES'
YAML.load(ENV['ROLES']).each do |role|
  Role.find_or_create_by_name({ :name => role }, :without_protection => true)
  puts 'role: ' << role
end
puts 'DEFAULT USERS'
user = User.find_or_create_by_email :first_name => ENV['ADMIN_FIRST_NAME'].dup, :last_name => ENV['ADMIN_LAST_NAME'].dup, :email => ENV['ADMIN_EMAIL'].dup, :password => ENV['ADMIN_PASSWORD'].dup, :password_confirmation => ENV['ADMIN_PASSWORD'].dup
puts 'user: ' << user.name
user.add_role :admin
user2 = User.find_or_create_by_email :first_name => 'Silver', :last_name => 'User', :email => 'user2@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
user2.add_role :silver
user3 = User.find_or_create_by_email :first_name => 'Gold', :last_name => 'User', :email => 'user3@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
user3.add_role :gold
user4 = User.find_or_create_by_email :first_name => 'Platinum', :last_name => 'User', :email => 'user4@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
user4.add_role :platinum
puts "users: #{user2.name}, #{user3.name}, #{user4.name}"
</pre>

The *db/seeds.rb* file reads a list of roles from the *config/application.yml* file and adds the roles to the database. In fact, any new role can be added to the roles datatable with a statement such @user.add_role :superhero@. Setting the roles in the *db/seeds.rb* file simply makes sure each role is listed and available should a user wish to change roles.

We add an administrator and three sample users. Our User model has separate first and last names to accommodate Recurly’s customer schema.

Values from the *config/application.yml* file are used to create a user with an administrator role. You can log in with this account for access as an administrator.

You can change the administrator name, email, and password in this file but it is better to make the changes in the *config/application.yml* file to keep the credentials private. If you decide to include your private password in the *db/seeds.rb* file, be sure to add the filename to your *.gitignore* file so that your password doesn't become available in your public GitHub repository.

Note that it's not necessary to personalize the *db/seeds.rb* file before you deploy your app. You can deploy the app with an example user and then use the application's "Edit Account" feature to change name, email address, and password after you log in. Use this feature to log in as an administrator and change the user name and password to your own.

h3. Set the Database

Prepare the database and add the default user to the database by running the commands:

<pre>
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
</pre>

Use @rake db:reset@ if you want to empty and reseed the database.

Set the database for running tests:

<pre>
$ rake db:test:prepare
</pre>

If you’re not using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, you should preface each rake command with @bundle exec@. You don’t need to use @bundle exec@ if you are using rvm version 1.11.0 or newer.

h3. The Recurly Initializer

The file *config/initializers/recurly.rb* sets the Recurly API key and cryptographic private key from environment variables:

<pre>
Recurly.api_key = ENV['RECURLY_API_KEY']
Recurly.js.private_key = ENV['RECURLY_JS_PRIVATE_KEY']
RECURLY_SUBDOMAIN = ENV['RECURLY_SUBDOMAIN']
# Recurly.default_currency = 'USD'
</pre>

You could hardcode the Recurly API key and cryptographic private key in the *config/initializers/recurly.rb* file but instead, we advise to set the Recurly API key and cryptographic private key in the *config/application.yml* file. Recording sensitive information in the *config/initializers/recurly.rb* file might expose it publicly on a GitHub repo. Both the Recurly API key and cryptographic private key should be kept secret; the Recurly subdomain can be revealed without consequence.

If you're not operating with US dollars as your currency, you can change the default in the initializer file.

h3. Prepare Your Recurly Account

Before we can submit a billing request to Recurly, we have to set up our subscription plans in Recurly.

We'll tell Recurly that we have three plans named "Silver", "Gold", and "Platinum" that will be billed monthly at rates of $9, $19, and $29. Once a customer is created and assigned a plan, Recurly will do all the work of notifying the user, initiating monthly billing, and contacting the user when a credit card is declined or expires.

Go to your Recurly account profile to create a subscription plan. Look for "Configuration/Subscription Plans." Recurly offers "documentation about creating subscriptions":https://docs.recurly.com/subscriptions and "additional detail about subscriptions":https://docs.recurly.com/api/subscriptions.

Create three different plans with the following values:

|_. Plan Name |_. Plan Code |_. Pricing |_. Interval |
| Silver | silver | 9.00 | monthly |
| Gold | gold | 19.00 | monthly |
| Platinum | platinum | 29.00 | monthly |

"Plan Name" is displayed on invoices and in the Recurly web interface. "Plan Code" is a unique string of your choice that is used to identify the plan when subscribing a customer. The "Plan Code" should correspond to a role we've created to manage access. "Pricing" is the subscription price. You'll specify the billing frequency. Optionally, you can specify a free trial period. If you include a trial period, the customer won't be billed for the first time until the trial period ends. If the customer cancels before the trial period is over, she'll never be billed at all.

h3. Recurly Push Notifications

When a credit card expires or a monthly transaction is declined, Recurly will automatically retry a recurring payment after it fails. After a number of attempts (set in your Recurly "Dunning Management" settings), Recurly will cancel the subscription. Your application needs to know to deny access for a subscriber with an expired account. Recurly provides "webhooks":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook (push notifications) to communicate events to you (for details, see the "Recurly Push Notifications documentation":http://docs.recurly.com/push-notifications and "Recurly Push Notifications API":http://docs.recurly.com/api/push-notifications).

A Recurly push notification is an HTTP request from Recurly's servers to your site. It is not a visit to your website from a web browser; rather it is an HTTP POST request (like a form submission) to your application from the Recurly servers. The HTTP request contains XML data that provides data about the event, including a customer account code that can be used to retrive the data from the Recurly server. It is best to ignore the event data (because it could be falsified) and query the Recurly server to obtain the subscription status.

The example application only responds to "expired_subscription_notification" events. You can customize the application to respond to other events.

For push notifications to work, you must visit your Recurly dashboard and enter the URL in your "Push Notifications" settings:

* http://www.example.com/recurly/push

h3. Change your Application's Secret Token

If you've used the Rails Composer tool to generate the application, the application's secret token will be unique, just as with any Rails application generated with the @rails new@ command.

However, if you've cloned the application directly from GitHub, it is crucial that you change the application's secret token before deploying your application in production mode. Otherwise, people could change their session information, and potentially access your SaaS or membership site as a premium user or administrator. Your secret token should be at least 30 characters long and completely random. Edit your *config/initializers/secret_token.rb* file:

<pre>
RailsRecurlySubscriptionSaas::Application.config.secret_token = '...some really long, random string...'
</pre>

h2. Test the App

You can check that your app runs properly by entering the command:

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

If you are using the default values from the *config/application.yml* file, you can sign in as the administrator using:

* email: user@example.com
* password: please

You'll see a navigation link for Admin. Clicking the link will display a page with a list of users at
"http://localhost:3000/users":http://localhost:3000/users.

To sign in as the second user, use

* email: user2@example.com
* password: please

The second user will not see the Admin navigation link and will not be able to access the page at
"http://localhost:3000/users":http://localhost:3000/users.

You should be able to create additional users using the fake credit card number _4111111111111111_. You'll see the new users listed when you log in as an administrator. And you'll see the new users listed as customers when you visit your Recurly dashboard.

Stop the server with Control-C.

If you test the app by starting the web server and then leave the server running while you install new gems, you’ll have to restart the server to see any changes. The same is true for changes to configuration files in the config folder. This can be confusing to new Rails developers because you can change files in the app folders without restarting the server. Stop the server each time after testing and you will avoid this issue.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here is a "Tutorial for Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

Be sure to set up SSL before you make your application available in production. See the "Heroku documentation on SSL":https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl.

Add this configuration parameter to the *config/application.rb* file:

<pre>
# Heroku requires this to be false
config.assets.initialize_on_precompile=false
</pre>

Then precompile assets, commit to git, and push to Heroku:

<pre>
$ rake assets:precompile
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "assets compiled for Heroku"
$ git push heroku master
</pre>

You'll need to set the configuration values from the *config/application.yml* file as Heroku environment variables. See the article "Rails Environment Variables":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-environment-variables.html for more information.

With the figaro gem, just run:

<pre>
rake figaro:heroku
</pre>

Alternatively, you can set Heroku environment variables directly.

The figaro gem version 0.5.0 has a bug and can't run @rake figaro:heroku@.

Set environment variables directly on Heroku with @heroku config:add@.

<pre>
$ heroku config:add GMAIL_USERNAME='myname@gmail.com' GMAIL_PASSWORD='secret'
$ heroku config:add 'ROLES=[admin, silver, gold, platinum]'
$ heroku config:add ADMIN_FIRST_NAME='First' ADMIN_LAST_NAME='User' ADMIN_EMAIL='user@example.com' ADMIN_PASSWORD='please'
$ heroku config:add RECURLY_API_KEY=secret RECURLY_JS_PRIVATE_KEY=secret RECURLY_SUBDOMAIN=mydomain
</pre>

Prior to deployment, change your *db/seeds.rb* file. Remove the "example.com" sample users.

<pre>
puts 'ROLES'
YAML.load(ENV['ROLES']).each do |role|
  Role.find_or_create_by_name({ :name => role }, :without_protection => true)
  puts 'role: ' << role
end
puts 'DEFAULT USERS'
user = User.find_or_create_by_email :name => ENV['ADMIN_NAME'].dup, :email => ENV['ADMIN_EMAIL'].dup, :password => ENV['ADMIN_PASSWORD'].dup, :password_confirmation => ENV['ADMIN_PASSWORD'].dup
puts 'user: ' << user.name
user.add_role :admin
</pre>

Complete Heroku deployment with:

<pre>
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
$ heroku run rake db:seed
</pre>

See the "Tutorial for Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html for details.

h2. Customizing

This application provides a fully functional membership site that is ready to take credit card payments and serve access to restricted content.

It uses Recurly for payment processing, allows users to change credit cards or subscription plans, and uses Recurly push notifications to delete users who have expired or declined credit cards.

If you have suggestions for additional features, please create an "issue":http://github.com/RailsApps/rails-recurly-subscription-saas/issues on GitHub.

h2. Testing

The application provides a suite of RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and step definitions.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.
